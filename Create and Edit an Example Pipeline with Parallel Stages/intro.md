In this learning lab, you will create and edit an example pipeline with parallel stages. 

The High Level Steps are:
1. Create and run a Pipeline in a feature branch
2. Add artifact and test result publishing to a Pipeline
3. Add parallel stages to a Pipeline
4. Save a Pipeline to the master branch

IMPORTANT: Before you begin this lab, ensure your Pipeline matches the solution from the previous lab. Use the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor and/or the Blue Ocean Pipeline Code Editor to make any changes needed.
