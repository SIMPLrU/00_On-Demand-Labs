Task: Review Pipeline resources

The Jenkins Pipeline features in this lab are not accessible via the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor. The rest of this lab will require some combination the Classic Web UI and the Blue Ocean Pipeline Code Editor.


Snippet Generator
	Most steps are visible from the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor, but sometimes you may want options that Blue Ocean does not yet support.

	Open the Snippet generator, select a step, add some value and generate a code snippet.
	
	Repeat this for a few different steps

Declarative Pipeline Documentation
	The Declarative Pipeline syntax cannot be generated by the Snippet Generator.

	As you perform the tasks in this lab you will need to refer to the Declarative Pipeline Syntax to know what Declarative Pipeline code to use.

IMPORTANT
Before you begin this lab, ensure your Pipeline matches the solution from the previous lab. Use the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor and/or the Blue Ocean Pipeline Code Editor to make any changes needed
