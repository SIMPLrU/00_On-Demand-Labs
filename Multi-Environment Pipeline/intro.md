In this learning lab, you will work with a multi-environment Pipeline

The High Level Steps are:
1. Create and run a Pipeline in another feature branch

2. Control the node on which a Pipeline or individual stages run

3. Stash and unstash files from one stage to the next

4. Build and run tests in parallel on two different agent environments

5. Wait for user input before deploying

6. Add a checkpoint from which a Pipeline can be restarted

7. Save a Pipeline to the master branch

IMPORTANT: Before you begin this lab, ensure your Pipeline matches the solution from the `previous lab.` Use the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor and/or the Blue Ocean Pipeline Code Editor to make any changes needed.
